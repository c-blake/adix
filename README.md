While this began just as a kind of adaptive index/hash table library, it has
grown into more a collection in the theme of database/big-data related data
structures & algorithms.  { Let's say the "ad" in "adix" now stands for
"ADvanced" | "AscenDant" as well as "adaptive" ;-) }  Most of these are *Ã  la
carte* and I hope you find them useful.  I try to keep the source code short &
to the point.  In particular, as an overview/index, here be:

 - The original associative lookup modules:
   - [ditab](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/ditab.html): direct-indexed
   table for small universe keys
   - [lptabz](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/lptabz.html): a hash table
   that should be safe for untrusted key sets
   - [metab](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/metab.html): an instantiation/
   table portability helper for lptabz
   - [btree](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/btree.html): a B-Tree with
   various optional features (histogram, ranks, bulk loading, etc.)

 - Basic Sorting: [nsort](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/nsort.html)
     Radix sort only by NEEDED BITS; Often 5-10X faster than `algorithm.sort` if
     you sort a lot of meso-scale data (merge sorts *always* win for HUGE data;
     Very few have it). (Could buffer writes to ensure full cache-line pokes.)

 - Basic Sketches (abbreviated/approximate stores; aka "Digests") for:
   - Membership: [bltab](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/bltab.html) (bit-
   level table; Like more successfully marketed Bloom|Cuckoo filters, but lower
   latency & slightly bigger)
   - Count Distinct: [uniqce](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/uniqce.html)
   aka count unique or cardinality estimation
   - Approx Most Often: [amoft](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/amoft.html)
   (aka approximate top-K most frequent | heavy-hitters)
   - Quantiles: [lghisto](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/lghisto.html) or
   [tdigest](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/tdigest.html) (for slower more
   accurate tail quantiles)
   - An amalgam: [`mvstat`](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/mvstat.html)
   that works like `std/stats` but supports `del`, i.e. sliding/moving windows
   over data streams (like a moving average) as well as moving or running
   quantiles via `lghisto`.  Also includes bulk array stats that in some compile
   modes get fully SIMD vectorized inner loops.

And some utility modules:
  - [althash](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/althash.html): salt-able
  alternate hash functions for lptabz
  - [xlang](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/xlang.html): Definitions for C
  refugees for bist
  - [sequint](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/sequint.html): a fixed stride
  "bit matrix" using "batch"/number ops.
  - [memutil](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/memutil.html): memory shifting
  utilities
  - [cumsum](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/cumsum.html): parallel prefix
  sum using Intel SIMD for nsort
  - [bitop](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/bitop.html): re-impl std/bitops
  things to be more CT friendly
  - [topk](https://c-blake.github.io/adix/adix/topk.html): spends 2X the (small)
  space of `std/heapqueue`-based top-k stream algo to scale O(lg k) better via
  what one might call "buffered quickselect".

A Word Of Caution
=================
While sketches are popular, like merge sort (vs. radix sort), they often need
huge data to pay off.  Essentially, probabilistic analysis ("Oh wow, I can do
that?!") distracts from space-time trade-offs.  This distraction is worsened by
there being space-time-accuracy "trade-off pyramids".

So, I can say here "spending a bit more space can yield major speed-ups", and it
sounds blatantly obvious to even the most casual observer.  Yet, I've also seen
it neglected in this context countless times.  The academic literature does not
help, often being "blood sport" for more compressed data | accuracy with no
regard to speed.

So, e.g., on my primary 32 GiB RAM dev box with `bu/zipf`, I cannot make exact
`lfreq` slower than Approximately Most Often sketches(`bu/oft`).  `tests/bl.nim`
shows another example (also written up
[here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/when-bloom-filters-dont-bloom/) in a Bloom
filter / membership approximation context where spending 2-4X what a Bloom takes
space-wise can buy a 7-10X latency shrink.  (Histograms & UCE are both pretty
good deals, though, if errors are acceptable, and `adix/bltab` with fingerprint
keys is arguably just "a better 'sketch' ").

A little more on LPTabz & friends
=================================
As a brief guide I would start with `NOTES.md` and then look at the top part of
`lptabz.nim`.  `TODO.md` also has a lot of notes in it.  My overarching vision
is to allow "the fast way" most of the time, especially for developers that know
how to provide a good `hash`, but to also have auto fall backs to "safer ways"
with optional messages to let devs know they may need to intervene by changing
some defaults at table construction time (or else let users/sysadmins know that
some input may be violating the assumptions of some code sensitive to inputs).
Commercial database systems may have done this for decades, but hasn't really
percolated into commonly available runtime libs.  (Depth-based growth trigger is
likely the simplest example of Profile-Guided Optimization for data structures.
A.Dain Samples 1993 PhD thesis has some more.)
